This folder contains patched versions of jQuery Mobile that work well with Netweaver BSP.


Technical details
-----------------
Netweaver request processing does a rewrite of urls to include additional data. So urls like

http://myserver.com/sap/bc/bsp/example/page.htm

will be mangled into something like

http://myserver.com/sap(bD1lbiZjPTgwMA==)/bc/bsp/example/page.htm

This should not be a problem, but the way jQuery Mobile is currently designed does not work well when there are parentheses in the url. A patch is available to work around the issue while a better solution is not added to jQM.

https://github.com/michaelhull/jquery-mobile/commit/0ecd1c71422f014a1ef1335763336251ebf6684f

The files in the folder are versions of jQM that already include the patch for extra commodity.
